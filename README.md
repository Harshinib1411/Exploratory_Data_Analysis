# Exploratory_Data_Analysis
Beginner-friendly Titanic dataset EDA using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Includes basic statistics, value counts, and visualizations like bar charts, histograms, box plots, and pie charts to explore passenger demographics and survival patterns.

# Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project performs a beginner-friendly Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger demographics, survival rates, and relationships between variables.

# Dataset
The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers, including:

Survived – Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0)

Pclass – Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)

Sex – Gender of the passenger

Age – Age in years

Fare – Ticket fare paid

Embarked – Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

# Steps Performed
Data Loading & Inspection – Checked the first few rows, data types, and missing values.

Basic Statistics – Summarized the dataset using .describe() for numerical columns.

Value Counts – Counted passengers by survival status and class.

# Visualizations –

Bar Chart: Survival by Gender

Histogram: Age Distribution

Box Plot: Fare vs Passenger Class

Pie Chart: Distribution of Passengers by Embarkation Port

# Tools Used
Python

Pandas – Data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

# Insights (Sample)
More male passengers than female passengers did not survive.

Younger passengers had varied survival rates, with children having slightly higher chances.

First-class passengers generally paid higher fares and had better survival chances.

Southampton was the most common port of embarkation.
